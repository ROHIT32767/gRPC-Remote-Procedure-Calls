Byzantine Failure Resolution
Overview: The Byzantine Fault Problem occurs in distributed systems when some nodes provide incorrect
or malicious responses, potentially leading to a system failure. To reach consensus despite faulty nodes, a
Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT) algorithm is required.
Problem Statement
Given n generals (of which one is the designated commander), of which at most t are traitors, implement a
simulation where:
•Each general starts with an initial decision (e.g., Attack or Retreat).
•Messages are exchanged synchronously with bounded delay.
•A consensus is reached despite the presence of traitors.
Solution Approach
The system must satisfy:
•Redundant Communication: Each general forwards received orders to all others.
•Majority Voting: Decisions are finalized based on the majority after t + 1 rounds.
•Consistency: Honest generals must reach the same decision.
Algorithm
1. The commander sends an order to all n −1 lieutenants.
2. Each lieutenant forwards the received message to others.
3. After t + 1 rounds, each general applies majority voting.
4. If the majority decision is ”Attack,” all agree on ”Attack”; otherwise, ”Retreat.”
Rounds of Simulation
The consensus process occurs over multiple rounds to ensure agreement among honest generals. Each round
refines the shared knowledge and eliminates uncertainty caused by traitorous generals.
•Round 1: Commander Broadcast
– The commander sends an order (e.g., ”Attack” or ”Retreat”) to all lieutenants.
•Round 2: Cross-Verification
– Each general asks every other general what order they received from the commander.
– This helps detect inconsistencies caused by a dishonest commander.
•Round 3: Secondary Verification
– Each general asks all others what responses they received in Round 2.
– This step increases reliability by filtering out misinformation.
•Rounds 4 to t + 1: Continued Propagation
– Messages continue to be exchanged among generals to refine collective agreement.
– Honest generals converge on the same decision using majority voting.

•Final Decision: Consensus
– After t + 1 rounds, each general finalizes a decision.
– The majority result determines the action (e.g., ”Attack” or ”Retreat”).
Expected Output
The program should take n (number of generals) and t (number of traitors) as input and simulate the
consensus process, printing the final agreed decision and the intermediate steps. There is no restriction on
the formatting of the output, but it should be readable since this is a simulation.
Note: Ensure correctness by meeting the conditions n > 3t and enforcing synchronized communication.
Task: Implement a simulation of a Byzantine Fault Tolerance algorithm to demonstrate how consensus
can be reached.
•Implement a simulation that solves the Byzantine Fault Problem.
•The input parameters are:
– n: The number of processes involved.
– t: The number of faulty nodes, where t < 4.
•The program should determine whether consensus can be reached despite faulty nodes.
•The output should clearly illustrate the process of reaching consensus or failing to do so.
•Ensure proper logging and debugging information to show steps in reaching agreement.
